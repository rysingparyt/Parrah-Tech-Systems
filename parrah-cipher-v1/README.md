# Parrah Cipher v1

A printable, offline-safe encryption system for storing and decoding passwords securely.
This tool is designed for survivors, students, and people rebooting their digital lives.

What is Parrah Cipher v1?
A lightweight personal encryption system designed for:
✅ Offline password storage
✅ Basic obfuscation (printable & coded)
✅ Human-friendly decoding
✅ Open-source adaptation and learning

⚙️ How It Works:
Step 1: Caesar Shift

Shift every letter forward by +7 (A → H, B → I, etc.)

Step 2: Character Swap Table

Letter	→	Code
A	→	@
E	→	3
I	→	!
O	→	0
S	→	$
T	→	+

Step 3: Add Prefix + Suffix

Prefix: XZ-

Suffix: -P7
This helps visually separate the encoded content from junk/spam.

🧠 Example:
Original password: Identity123
Encrypted: XZ-PKLU@P@F123-P7
(You can write this down, store it in a notebook, and decode it easily later.)

## Features
- Caesar shift + character swaps
- Printable-friendly output
- Easy to decode by hand


 Why Share This?
Because security shouldn’t be complicated or reserved for experts. I’m building tools I can trust and teach—and I’m hoping others who want to build their digital discipline can fork this and make it their own.

This is also part of a bigger reboot I’m working on: new emails, a new AI project, and a personal mission to build safe, open tools for privacy, AI ethics, and survivor resilience.
